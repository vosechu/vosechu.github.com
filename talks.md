I don't do a lot of talks, and when I do they usually aren't recorded, but for
those that are I wanted to have a place where I could showcase them because I'm
proud of this part of my life.

## Railsconf 2014

This talk came shortly on the heels of leaving PCS and starting a job as an
internal trainer with New Relic. I wanted to catalog the things I had done at
ELC/Burnside Digital, and the things I was trying to do at New Relic.

What surprised me was the number of people who wanted to talk about their
experiences after the talk. I wasn't the only one trying to do this, and their
experiences were enlightening to me. It's great to know that there are so many
people working on this!
