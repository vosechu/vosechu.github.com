title: Overview of Performance Metrics
---

Performance metrics, activities, and standards, allow us to focus in on what's actually important when we're studying. This file has been approached from the standpoint of the employer:

* **Basic skills** are those skills that are assumed to be true. When interviewing, if a candidate doesn't have these skills it can sometimes come as a shock to the interviewer. This is the baseline.
* **Intermediate skills** are the skills that start to set you apart from the rest of the candidate pool. These are skills that are learned over time and absolutely make you a better developer if you can memorize or somehow find a way to do them without thinking. If you're specializing in an area, this is the group to make sure you know 100%.
* **Advanced skills** are the skills that really set you apart and can put you in a position where you're picking from employers. These skills will often take time and research, but if you're wanting to master an area, you should be familiar. If you're specializing in an area, you should at least understand these skills and be able to implement them fairly quickly if you have access to your bookmarks.

_You should come out of the program with all of the Basics in every category._ Exams are generally confined to the basic skills and leave the intermediate and advanced skills as extra credit.

When you do stage 2 problems, keep these performance metrics in mind to focus you on results.
