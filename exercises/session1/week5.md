* Announcements
* Network points awards
* Networking events for the week
* Call for lightning talks

### Monday comprehension questions
* What's an API server
* What's an API

## Monday &mdash; 3/4/2013
### Topics
* Sinatra

### Goals
* Understand Sinatra, routing, and templates

### Definitions
* Sinatra: Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort
* Route: A route is an HTTP method paired with a URL-matching pattern.
* Template: A template is a generic HTML file with some way to allow you to insert context-appropriate data directly. The most common is the layout file.

### Important Threshold Concepts

### Reading to do before class
* [Sinatra README](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html)
* [ERB README](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html)

### Resources
* [EventSource JS Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)
* [Original chat app by rkh (not working anymore)](https://gist.github.com/rkh/1476463)
* [Sinatra-contrib](http://www.sinatrarb.com/contrib/)

### Helpful Commands
{% highlight bash %}
gem install sinatra-gen

# Generate the project. --tiny uses 'classic' sinatra
sinatra-gen sinatra-long-poll --tiny --test=spec --views=erb get:/subscribe post:/message

# Start the server properly
RACK_ENV=development be ruby sinatra-long-poll.rb
{% endhighlight %}

### Code for the board
{% highlight ruby %}
# Routing
get '/'
get '/:id' do
  # params[:id]
get '/:id' do |id|
  # id
get '/users/*'
  # params[:splat]

# Templates and processing
require 'erb'
template = ERB.new "The value of x is: <%= @x %>"
@x = 42
template.result(binding) #=> The value of x is: 42

# Sass / Coffee compilation
get '/css/pages.css' do
  sass :pages # ./views/pages.scss
end
get '/js/application.js' do
  # requires execjs or therubyracer
  coffee :application # ./views/application.coffee
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Exercises

#### Stage 1 (remembering/understanding)

* Answer these questions with your group
  * What is Sinatra
  * What is a route
  * What is a named parameter
  * What is a splat parameter
  * What is a template
  * What folder can I put static assets in
  * How do you use an ERb file
  * Where is the default layout file located
  * How do you specify a non-default layout
  * How do you pass variables to the template
  * How do you redirect to another page

#### Stage 2 (application/analyzing)

* I've built a chat script but it has a couple bugs and it's missing some features
* Start off by getting the app running.
* In a small group, try to tackle each of the TODOs. Brainstorm them first and make sure you understand the problem.
* Make sure that you can access each other's chat room.

#### Boss Fight (evaluation/creation)

* Rather than relying on params for the username, rely on a session
* Add in Rack::Test to ensure that at least the first couple of routes are working. Don't test the long-polling stuff.
* Add in a rake task to send a POST for manual testing

## Tuesday &mdash; 3/5/2013

### Exercises

#### Stage 0

* Find a hat. Inside that hat will be instructions.

#### Stage 1 (remembering/understanding)

* Pair these statements
  * Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units
  * Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers
  * What actions is this object responsible for?
  * What information does this object share?
  * When a method is invoked on an object, the object itself determines what code gets executed
  * The creation of self-contained modules that bind processing functions to their data.
  * "x" Enforces Modularity
  * Classes are created in hierarchies, and "x" allows the structure and methods in one class to be passed down the hierarchy.
  * "x" Passes "Knowledge" Down
  * A special variable (syntactically it may be a keyword), usually called this or self, that allows a method body to invoke another method body of the same object.

* With these philosophies or concepts
  * Law of Demeter
  * Responsibility-driven Design
  * Dynamic Dispatch
  * Encapsulation
  * Inheritance/Delegation
  * Open Recursion

#### Stage 2 (application/analyzing)

* In your group, map out the Stage 0 project on paper. You can use CRC style or whatever makes sense to your group.
* Using the project you selected on Monday, analyze the project and make CRC cards or map out how the models are going to interact. You don't have to get it right.

#### Boss Fight (evaluation/creation)

* Research prototype-style hierarchies and compare them with Object-oriented hierarchies. They share a lot in common, but it's the differences that are interesting.
* Start building your models in Sinatra and how they interact with each other.

  * Don't start on the project yet, just practice thinking through the database needs
  * Make sure that your database is in third normal form (3NF)

* In class
  * Using the datamapper config from last week, create an object for a user with a username and a password
  * When a user logs in to your chat app, check the database to ensure that their username and password match
  * Use BCrypt to store and check the password of a user

#### Boss Fight (evaluation/creation)

* Go farther with the chat database and start storing chat messages associated with a user.
* Create an index page of all things a user has said
* Move on to working on your project

$('.toggle-all').on 'click', (e) ->
  $('.collapsable').slideToggle()

{% endhighlight %}

### Exercises

#### Stage 1 (remembering/understanding)

* Answer these questions with your group
  * Why do we have to wait until document.ready
  * What is the condensed form of domready
  * How do you select elements with jQuery
  * Why should we use the CDN version of jQuery

#### Stage 2 (application/analyzing)

* With your group, using your chat app, have the new chat messages slide in instead of appearing
* When you click on a username, make it appear in the text field with an @ next to it
* If an @yourusername appears, make it bold and colorful
* If an image url comes into the page, display it
* Give each line of chat a different colored background so it's easy to read
* Give each user their own colored background
* If you click on an image, collapse it and hide it
