### Main project

<!-- Replacing followcost.com with a command-line utility

Followcost was a great site when it began but it had a few problems.  Now that its off the Internet it has even more.

Our goal is to make a replacement command line app that will tell us who our most prolific twitter people are and possibly give recommendations about who to unfollow. Details follow the steps.

#### Steps

Step 1: Start building the script without tests. After the 3:30 walk, switch to writing tests for the code you already have.

Reflection activity: how often do you need to change your code to make it work for the tests?

Step 2: Delete the code you wrote yesterday except for the tests. Without referencing the code from yesterday, try to recreate just by running the test suite.

Reflection activity: how many times did you get into a rabbit hole when you were just trying to make the test suite green?

Step 3: This time, delete all the code and the tests. Instead, start with a sheet of paper and write out all the features you want. Once you have a list of features, write out the tests and make sure they're red. Once they're red, add `skip` to the beginning of all but the easiest test. Start writing code to satisfy the tests. If you complete all your features write more tests and add more features.

Reflection activity: when you focus on the features instead of the code, how different do your tests look?

#### Details

Followcost.com rated your friends in milliscobles, a fictitious unit which was defined thusly: "'1/1000 of the average daily Twitter status updates by Robert Scoble as of 10:09 CST September 25, 2008.' At that time, Scoble was averaging 21.21 tweets per day, so a milliscoble is 0.02121 tweets per day."

Our script should do several things:

* Take a username and calculate their milliscoble rating
* Take a username and find the milliscoble rating of all their friends
* Sort those users with the highest number of milliscobles and output it to the terminal
* Run via the terminal

To create a command-line interface you should use Thor or Rake. Thor docs can be found here: [Thor](http://whatisthor.com/)

To create network connections use ruby's built-in 'net/http': [net/http docs](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html), [cheat sheet](http://www.rubyinside.com/nethttp-cheat-sheet-2940.html)

Twitter's search api can be found here: [search api](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/search). That should do most of the work but there may be other api endpoints that you need. -->

#### Homework

In addition to committing and pushing each night, please add a note to your notes repo with the answer to the reflection activity and any other thoughts from the day. This should be > 100 words each day.
