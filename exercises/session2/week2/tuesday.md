### Morning warmup

* [Jumpstart #5 - Grandma](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises/tree/master/05-grandma)

### Daily announcements
### Comprehension activities

* Pop-quiz

### Comprehension questions

* What is a boolean expression?
* Can you use boolean expressions outside of an if statement?
* What does it typically mean when a method has a ! in it?
* What does it typically mean when a method ends with a question mark?

### Lecture activities

* Mini-lecture

### Lecture topic

* Writing tests for existing code

### Lecture notes

Where to start:

* Get it running without any assertions (exercise it) and try using some of the methods
* Read through the code first, try to get a feeling for what's happening
* List all methods and some sample inputs and outputs
* Put a plus in a comment above any methods that look complicated
* Put a plus in a comment above any methods that are used by other classes
* Put a minus in a comment above any methods that look private or are only used internally
* Write comments about what you think the code does
* Write out what you think the main use cases are
* Write out what you think some of the edge cases are
* Write out at least one test case for each method that has a non-negative score in the comments
* Write out one test for each use/edge case

### Exercise activities

* Ping pong/Rallcar

### Exercise

* Fork and clone https://github.com/pootsbook/tdd
* Do not look at the tests yet
* Follow the steps above and try to create tests for money.rb

Notes:

You are missing a lot of information, this is normal. We are simulating what happens when you inherit a bunch of code that wasn't written test-first.

The hope is that this will be achievable but painful.

### Afternoon warmup

* Practice OS X Shortcuts
* Work with your table to find a way to share shortcuts or flash cards
* Practice typing

### Exercise

* Do step two of the main project

Note:

This is time to engage with your lessons today, not to work on homework for tomorrow. While I may not be here watching over you, this is valuable time when I'm not driving your schedule. Play, research, inquire, engage with today's discussion in your way.
