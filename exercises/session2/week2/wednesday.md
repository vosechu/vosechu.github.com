### Morning warmup

* [Jumpstart #6 - Robot name](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises/tree/master/06-robot-name)

### Daily announcements
### Comprehension activities

* Sharing time: Go around and ask what methods people found and why they think they're cool.

### Comprehension questions

* Do a little research on apidock.com and find 5 methods on String that you think are interesting and could be useful.

### Lecture activities
### Lecture topic

* Writing code that passes existing tests

### Lecture notes

Things that go wrong:

* `require`-ing files that don't exist. Make the file.
* `NameError: uninitialized constant Steubing`. Make the class Steubing.
* `NoMethodError: undefined method 'steubing' for Kernel:Module`. Make the class method 'steubing'.
* `NoMethodError: undefined method 'finagle' for "steubing":String`. Make the instance method 'finagle'.
* `NoMethodError: undefined method 'finagle' for nil:NilClass`. Figure out what variable is missing.

Steps:

* Get autotest/watchr running. This is very important.
* Remove skip from first test.
* Get it to "F" instead of "E".
* Fix so that it says "." instead of "F".
* Repeat.

### Exercise

Note:

This is time to engage with your lessons today, not to work on homework for tomorrow. While I may not be here watching over you, this is valuable time when I'm not driving your schedule. Play, research, inquire, engage with today's discussion in your way.
