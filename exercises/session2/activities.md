* Small group, teacher assisted
* Partners, peer assisted
* Independent, student autonomy

30min+

* Mini-lecture
* Group-teach
  * Comprehension questions in depth
  * Pick a topic to teach to the class in small groups
  * Take one group in another room and teach them a topic, other group researches
* I-do-we-do-you-do
* Problem-based-learning (present a problem, see how the tools for today solve the problem)
* Think-pair-share (ponder large question, turn to neighbor and discuss, share with class)
* Hands-on (tower, pbj, etc)
* Q&A (they should come prepared with questions on the text)
* Retrospective
* Hot seat: split class, one rep from each group sits with back to board. Write a term or a code snippet on the board and the others in the group have to get the person to say that term without looking
* Jeopardy (team based, 1 minute to discuss, all three teams answer)

10min

* predictions before lecture – predict what's going to be hardest in this lecture/activity
* Write a test question – write a question that demonstrates that you know this topic
* 30-second radio spot – define a thing in your best radio voice. Most students define the same thing
* 30-second radio spot except only to your neighbor/table
* 3-minute pause – ask trigger question, enforce 3 minutes of discussion with neighbor/table
* Truth statements – generate 3 things that you know about this topic already
* Paper questions – Instead of asking if there are questions, have students write 1-2 questions on a 3x5. Sharing is optional
* Paper airplane – Paper question except that they're delivered by folded airplane
* Make a poster about a memorization topic – Everyone picks a single Git command, makes a poster about that command

Comprehension questions

* Evens/Odds
* Rotation (first student answers a question and then asks the next question of a student that they choose)
* Which problem is the hardest? (then answer them together)
* 1-min lightning talk (3-min prep)
* Quiz
* 3x5 flashcard creation
* Random-pair (every pair writes down a number)

Trigger statements

* Discuss with your neighbor the main point of this mini-lecture
* Discuss with your pair what the hardest part is so far

Exercise activities:

Memorize
* Race/time-trial
* Drills
* Make flashcards together
* Make an anecdote / story telling
* Make a mnemonic
* Make a poster for the classroom

Discovery/ownership
* Write a wiki-page on a topic
* Write a reflective blog
* Group research and share: everyone researches at once and shares links as they find them
* Find a better way: everyone researches a better way to do something. A new gem, a new technique, etc.
* Discovery-process – figure out how to do these things

Practice
* 30min rotations
* 1hr partner switch

Synthesis
* 2-hour client project emergency
* Ping-pong/Rallycar
* Project idea for a new student just learning this topic
* Product pitch something new that would use this technology
* Recreate a classic game
