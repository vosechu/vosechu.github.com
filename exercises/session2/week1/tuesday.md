* What is a variable?
* How do you call a method on a variable?
* How do you define methods?
* How do you define methods that take arguments?
* What does it mean to return from a method?

* What values are falsy in Ruby
* How do you stop a ruby program that is stuck in an infinite loop?
* What do `&&` and `||` do?

* What is an instance?
* What is a function/method?
* What is a boolean expression?
* What is a return value?

### Morning exercise activities

* 30min pairing rotations

### Morning exercise

* 30-min rotations with your pair. Each of you should work on your own account on codeacademy.com. The second time through should go much faster.

### Afternoon warmup

* Practice OS X Shortcuts
* Work with your table to find a way to share shortcuts or flash cards
* Practice typing

### Lecture topic

* Pair Programming

### Lecture activities

* Mini-lecture
* Role-play (2 adv students make a boilerplate html page)

### Lecture notes

Pair programming attributes:

Driver:

* Quick thinker
* Typing speed
* Vocal problem solver
* Higher or even skill level

Navigator:

* Detail oriented
* Thinks about the broad topics
* Reads others' code and remembers it very well
* Comfortable interrupting
* Understands drivers flow and web to interrupt

Ideal pairings:

* Rallycar (Driver/Navigator, similar skill)
* Evil Coder (Navigator/Navigator, any skill)
* Ping Pong (Driver/Driver, small difference in skill)

Sub-optimal pairings:

* Commander/grunt (any/any, navigator stronger)
* Confused navigator (Driver/navigator, driver stronger)
* Hot mess (any/any, both low skill level)

Things that may go wrong:

* Disparate typing speed
* Driver not talking out loud
* Navigator getting into rabbit hole / researching on their own screen

Role-play:

* Ask for two volunteers to show pair programming
* Audience gets to critique and ask questions about the process

### Exercise activities

* Pair programming practice

### Exercise

Split into pairs:

* Driver vs navigator vs unsure/both
* Order by skill level
* Identify 3 people:
  1. Person across from you
  2. Person 2 to your right
  3. Person across and 2 to the right

Continue through Codeacademy.com Ruby track with each person. Switch drivers every 30 minutes, switch partners every hour. Take notes about what feels right and what doesn't.

Take 10-min stretch breaks every hour!
